# YouTim: Javascript UTM Conversion library

## Introduction

YouTim is a Javascript library containing functions for converting between UTM and geographic coordinates and vice versa. It also has some general-purpose functions for converting between degree and degree-minute coordinate formats and rendering coordinates as strings.

## Demo

YouTim includes a few examples:

* [UTM conversion demo](utmdemo.htm)
* [Find Center of Circle, given 3 Points on the Circumference](centercirc.htm)
* [Find intersection of two circles](isectcirc.htm)

## Source Code

To view or clone the code, see: [https://github.com/mortonfox/YouTim/tree/gh-pages](https://github.com/mortonfox/YouTim/tree/gh-pages)
